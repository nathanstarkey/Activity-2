                        I am currently entering my final year here at UNO. I am majoring in Management Information Systems.
                        I was fortunate enough to land an internship at Union Pacific over a year ago in their Server Infrastructure Systems department for Windows Servers. basically, I am a server admin.
                        I have enjoyed my experience so far and have learned a great deal about how the infrastructure works in conjusction with everything else.
